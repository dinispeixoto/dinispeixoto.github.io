      <description>While I was setting up Google Analytics for this website, something that should be straightforward as Hugo already provides an internal template for this, I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed that my requests were not being tracked and displayed in the Google Analytics dashboard.
I started by making sure that the internal template was actually being properly used and then, just in case, that the tracking id was correct. Both seemed to be ok.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m Dinis Peixoto, a software engineer based in Braga, Portugal. ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¹ I have been working at farfetch (an e-commerce luxury platform ðŸ‘ ) for almost 2 years now.
I consider myself an eager to learn person, always with a learn-by-doing philosophy in mind. Other than that, I really like to feel challenged as it enables me to not only learn new things but also improve my problem solving skills.
I truly believe that teaching is one of the best ways to learn, that&amp;rsquo;s why I&amp;rsquo;m currently mentoring csharp and python at exercism.</description>
