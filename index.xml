      <description>Object-oriented programming in Python is far from being perfect. There are, however, some built-in functions that help programmers achieve OOP as we can find in truly OOP languages like Java or C#. Today I will try to clarify the purpose of two built-in decorators that are widely used in the context of OOP: @staticmethod and @classmethod.
Let&amp;rsquo;s consider the example below of an Example python class, with a method (method), a static method (static_method) and a class method (class_method).</description>

      <title>Brand Recommendations - TF-IDF</title>

      <description>I have been trying to learn Machine Learning for quite some time now. The main motivation for this was the fact that, at FARFETCH, I work really close to a data science team and wanted to get a grasp of the main challenges that they have to face on a daily basis.
It all started with a couple of online courses. The thing with these courses is that you get to learn a lot of cool stuff supported with step-by-step tutorials, but I never took some time to actually build something on my own, that tackles a real issue that I&amp;rsquo;m facing.</description>

      <title>Force Python to release memory</title>

      <description>Let me start by clarifying that there are far better solutions to manage Python&amp;rsquo;s memory other than the one I&amp;rsquo;ll showcase here. The solution/workaround that I will present was appropriate for the problem I was facing, which included having to process multiple really large pickle objects. Please note that loading multiple of these objects to memory was not even an option as they could take up to 20 Gs of memory.</description>

      <description>At FARFETCH, teams are encouraged to try new development methodologies so that they can deliver even better results while also improving productivity. As a fairly new team, we have continuously been looking for different methodologies that best fit our needs, such as avoiding knowledge silos or a slow-paced reviewing process. Although not every approach that we have tried has worked, the ones that did are now part of our daily development workflow and play a key role in the outcome of the tasks that we deliver.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s always fun when you find something entirely new, especially when it&amp;rsquo;s a quirk/feature on a tool that you use daily. This time around, I&amp;rsquo;ll be writing about git, in particular an option that you can use when stagging content for your next commit.
Most of the times, I either use git add &amp;lt;file&amp;gt; or if I&amp;rsquo;m sure that every unstaged change should be stagged, git add . will do the job.</description>

      <title>Do Not Track - HTTP header</title>

      <description>While I was setting up Google Analytics for this website, something that should be straightforward as Hugo already provides an internal template for this, I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed that my requests were not being tracked and displayed on the Google Analytics dashboard.
I started by making sure that the internal template was actually being properly used and then, just in case, that the tracking id was correct. Both seemed to be ok.</description>

      <title>Hey there! ðŸ‘‹</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m Dinis Peixoto, a software engineer based in Braga, Portugal. ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¹ I have been working at FARFETCH (an e-commerce luxury platform ðŸ‘ ) for over 2 years now.
I consider myself an eager to learn person, always with a learn-by-doing philosophy in mind. Other than that, I really like to feel challenged as it enables me to not only learn new things but also improve my problem solving skills.
I truly believe that teaching is one of the best ways to learn, that&amp;rsquo;s why I&amp;rsquo;m currently mentoring csharp and python at exercism.</description>
