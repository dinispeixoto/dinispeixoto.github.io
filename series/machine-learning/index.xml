      <description>Fundamentals Linear regression is a technique used to find the relationship between variables, in the context of machine learning that essentially means the relationship between features and labels.&#xA;It can be represented as follows:&#xA;$$ \hat{y} = \text{b} + w_1 x_1 + w_2 x_2 + \dots + w_n x_n $$ \(\hat{y}\) is the label \(\text{b}\) is the bias \(w_i\) is the weight of the feature i \(x_i\) is the feature value of feature i Loss Functions Loss is usually the metric we optimize the model for, it essentially tells us how wrong the model is - it measures the distance between the model&amp;rsquo;s predictions (\(\text{y}\)) and the actual labels (\(\hat{y}\)).</description>

      <description>Fundamentals Logistic Regression models, unlike Linear Regression, should help us predict the probability of a given outcome - e.g. if a payment is fraudulent or not. A Logistic Regression model, just like in Linear Regression can be represented as follows:&#xA;$$ \text{z} = \text{b} + w_1 x_1 + w_2 x_2 + \dots + w_n x_n $$ \(\text{z}\) is the output of the linear equation, also called the log odds. \(\text{b}\) is the bias.</description>
