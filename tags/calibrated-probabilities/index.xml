      <description>Please keep in mind that this will be a quite simple explanation of calibrated probabilities and how they are important. In order to learn more about how to use them for a specific type of model please refer to the References section below.&#xA;Let&amp;rsquo;s consider we are training a binary classification model that predicts whether a random photo has a dog or not, the predicted score will be a value from 0 to 1 (or 0 to 100%), ideally representing the probability of the image actually having a dog.</description>
