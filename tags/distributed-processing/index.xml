      <description>Apache Spark is a distributed processing platform used for big data workloads. It is usually used for data or machine learning pipelines that require processing large amounts of data.&#xA;Spark&amp;rsquo;s architecture includes several components, which we will describe next.&#xA;Driver Program When creating and running a Spark application, it starts by running in the driver machine, e.g. your own machine. However, in order to fully leverage Spark, applications need to run as a set of independent processes in a cluster, as this is what enables the distributed processing and horizontal scaling we need for big data.</description>
