      <description>During the past few days, I have been working on running batch inference for a large amount of data using Spark. The goal was to generate embeddings:
 text embeddings using a fine-tuned BERT model image embeddings using a fine-tuned ViT model  I will use this TIL to share some of the key learnings I could get from this experience.
Pandas UDF vs Spark UDF Pandas UDF instead of Spark UDF helps improve performance, also allows running in batches of rows/partition instead of a single row/partition (everything&amp;rsquo;s explained here).</description>

      <description>Apache Spark is a distributed processing platform used for big data workloads. It is usually used for data or machine learning pipelines that require processing large amounts of data.
Spark&amp;rsquo;s architecture includes several components, which we will describe next.
Driver Program When creating and running a Spark application, it starts by running in the driver machine, e.g. your own machine. However, in order to fully leverage Spark, applications need to run as a set of independent processes in a cluster, as this is what enables the distributed processing and horizontal scaling we need for big data.</description>
