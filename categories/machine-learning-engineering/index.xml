      <description>During the past few days, I have been working on running batch inference for a large amount of data using Spark. The goal was to generate embeddings:
text embeddings using a fine-tuned BERT model image embeddings using a fine-tuned ViT model I will use this TIL to share some of the key learnings I could get from this experience.
Pandas UDF vs Spark UDF Pandas UDF instead of Spark UDF helps improve performance, also allows running in batches of rows/partition instead of a single row/partition (everything&amp;rsquo;s explained here).</description>

      <description>Apache Spark is a distributed processing platform used for big data workloads. It is usually used for data or machine learning pipelines that require processing large amounts of data.
Spark&amp;rsquo;s architecture includes several components, which we will describe next.
Driver Program When creating and running a Spark application, it starts by running in the driver machine, e.g. your own machine. However, in order to fully leverage Spark, applications need to run as a set of independent processes in a cluster, as this is what enables the distributed processing and horizontal scaling we need for big data.</description>

      <description>I have been trying to learn Machine Learning for quite some time now. The main motivation for this was the fact that, at FARFETCH, I work really close to a data science team and wanted to get a grasp of the main challenges that they have to face on a daily basis.
It all started with a couple online courses. The thing with these courses is that you get to learn a lot of cool stuff supported with step-by-step tutorials, but I never took some time to actually build something on my own, that tackles a real issue that I&amp;rsquo;m facing.</description>
